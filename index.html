                For years, students have dealt with the anxiety of balancing school and their social life, but in 2020 a newcomer entered the equation. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC!  
                 No one around the world was prepared for this new addition. The pandemic had shaken our "normal" way of life. Before we could travel freely, 
                 hang out with friends or even take leisure stroll outside. However, with covid, came restriction, lockdowns and curfew.Who would have thought that stand at least 6 feet apart would become the new norm? 
                 Having to sanitise your hand on the entrance to every new building; or wearing a mask every time you leave your house. 
             </p>
             <p>
                As university students, we deal with a lot of stress daily, but with covid, we had to adjust of lives drastically. Our whole university experience was shifted to an online platform.
                We no longer had the choice to take part in campus life, interact with our hallmates face to face or study in the university library.
                Learning to balance school life and covid-19 was something no one expected. It has been almost two years since the pandemic has started, and the struggle to balance plague us.

             There are three approved and authorized vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. Pfizer-BioNTech is approved for a person 12 years and older and
             is required to take two shots. These shots are three weeks (21 days) apart, and the person is only full vaccinated two weeks after the second shot. Moderna is for persons 
             18 years and older and is required to take two shots. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, the shots are four weeks (28 days) apart. The patient is fully vaccinated two weeks after 
             the second shot. With the Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, you must be 18 years and older and only require one shot. Like other vaccines, persons are fully vaccinated after two weeks.
         </p>
        
         <p>
             Each vaccine has similar side effects. Patients reported pain, redness and swelling in the arm where they got the shot and tiredness, fever and muscle pain throughout the rest of 
             the body. They also reported chills, headaches and nausea. To reduce the pain and discomfort after the shot, patients were advised to apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth to the area 
             and use or exercise the arm. They were also advised to drink plenty of fluid and wear little fabrics.
